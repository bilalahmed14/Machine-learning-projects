# Data analysis and Machine learning projects

This is a repository of complete Projects, code, and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

Each repository will (usually) correspond to the Machine learning or Data science Projects.

Be sure to check the documentation (usually in IPython Notebook format) in the directory you're interested in for the notes on the analysis, data usage terms, etc.

If you don't have the necessary software installed to run IPython Notebook, don't fret. You can use nbviewer to view a notebook on the web.

For example, if you want to view the notebook in the "Sentiment Analysis Project Using Pythonâ€™s Scikit-Learn" directory, copy the full link to the notebook then paste it into nbviewer.
